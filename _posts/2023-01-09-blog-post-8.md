Preface
======
Social networks have become an inseparable part of our lives. Every moment, millions of new contents are produced and shared in these networks. What was interesting for me personally was the first post of famous social networks. In this post, we will review the first posts.


## Youtube

YouTube is a global online video sharing and social media platform headquartered in San Bruno, California. It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google, and is the second most visited website, after Google Search.

"Me at the zoo" is the first video uploaded to YouTube, on April 23, 2005, 8:31:52 p.m. PDT, or April 24, 2005, at 03:31:52 UTC. The 19-second video features YouTube's co-founder Jawed Karim, who was 25 years old at the time, in front of two elephants at the San Diego Zoo in California, noting their long trunks.

## Instagram

Instagram is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers.

The story, rather fittingly, begins with a picture of a dog. Kevin Systrom's photograph of a stray dog sitting near a taco stand in Mexico is the first image ever shared on Instagram. The app's co-founder captioned it 'test', and uploaded it a few months before his idea was launched to the public on October 6 2010.

## Twitter

Twitter, Inc. is an American social media company based in San Francisco, California. The company operates the microblogging and social networking service Twitter. It previously operated the Vine short video app and Periscope livestreaming service.

Twitterâ€™s first tweet was posted by Twitter Founder, Jack Dorsey [@jack](https://twitter.com/jack) on March 21, 2006. Shortly afterward, Jack began inviting coworkers â€” and the rest is history!

## Reddit

Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website. Registered users submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members.

The first post on Reddit was posted by [The Downing Street Memo](http://www.downingstreetmemo.com) about 18 years ago.

## Quora

## Stackoverflow

Stack Overflow is a question and answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers. It is the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network. It was created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming.

The post was deleted shortly after being created; Jarred Dixon asked it, Jeff Atwood didn't 'approve' and removed it again. Question #4 was created by a test account, posts [#6](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6), [#8](https://stackoverflow.com/q/8), [#9](https://stackoverflow.com/q/9), [#11](https://stackoverflow.com/q/11), [#13](https://stackoverflow.com/q/13), [#16](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16) and [#17](https://stackoverflow.com/q/17) are all 'seed' content created by Jeff Atwood, Geoff Dalgas and Kevin Dente, with another [question #14](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14) being a seed question using a test account; these were posted before the first outside beta testers were given access.

So you could also say that [What is the fastest way to get the value of Ï€?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19/what-is-the-fastest-way-to-get-the-value-of-Ï€) is the very first, it is the first question that is not test or seed content.
