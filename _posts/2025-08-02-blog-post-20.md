Preface
======
Struggling to find the best product management courses or don’t have time to take them all? I’ve summarized over 110 top-rated PM courses into one free, accessible GitHub repository. Save hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars while leveling up your product game—fast.

# 🧠 Introducing the PM Bible: Your Shortcut to Mastering Product Management

Product management is an ever-evolving discipline. Whether you’re just breaking into the field or you’ve been shipping products for years, one thing remains true: *you never stop learning*. But keeping up with the best practices, new tools, frameworks, and skills can be overwhelming—not to mention expensive and time-consuming.

That’s why I created the **[PM Bible](https://github.com/AlirezaSN/PM-Bible)**—a free, community-accessible repository that summarizes over **110 of the most popular product management courses** from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, Product School, Skillshare, and more.

In this post, I’ll walk you through what the PM Bible is, why I built it, and how it can save you **over 400 hours** of learning and **thousands of dollars** in course fees—while still delivering the most essential product management knowledge you need.

## 📘 What is the PM Bible?

The PM Bible is a **comprehensive knowledge base of product management course summaries**. Think of it as your personal product management learning assistant—one that has already done the hard work of watching the lectures, taking notes, and organizing the insights.

You’ll find concise summaries of courses from the most credible learning platforms including:

- ✅ **Coursera**
- ✅ **Udemy**
- ✅ **LinkedIn Learning**
- ✅ **Pendo**
- ✅ **Pluralsight**
- ✅ **Skillshare**
- ✅ **LiveLessons**
- ✅ **Product School**
- ✅ **Oreilly**
- ✅ **Udacity**
- ✅ **Lynda**

Each summary is provided as a standalone PDF, which means you can jump into exactly the topic you want without any friction.

## 🎯 Why I Created the PM Bible

As a product manager myself, I’ve been on the hunt for resources to level up my skills. Over time, I realized three major pain points:

1. **Time Constraints**: Watching dozens of hours of course videos is unrealistic with a full-time job.
2. **Repetition Across Courses**: Many courses repeat the same fundamental concepts but don’t always present them in a compact, comparative way.
3. **Cost Barrier**: Subscribing to multiple platforms or buying individual courses adds up quickly—often without knowing if the content is worth it.

So, I spent the last year going through **over 110 courses**, curating the most important takeaways, and condensing them into digestible PDFs for myself. Eventually, I realized: *Why not share this with the community?*

Thus, the PM Bible was born.
