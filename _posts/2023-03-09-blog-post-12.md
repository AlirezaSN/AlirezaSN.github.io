Preface
======
As a Product Manager (or a Product Owner), communication is a key aspect of your role. You are responsible for ensuring that everyone involved in product development is on the same page, both internally and externally. In this blog post, i'll explore who a Product Manager communicates with and why each communication is essential.

## Why Communication is Crucial?

Communication plays a crucial role in ensuring that everyone is aligned with the product development process. Communication weeds out confusion, delays and ensures that everyone has a clear understanding of the product vision, goals and objectives. Moreover, regular communication with customers, industry experts, and other external stakeholders can help identify potential issues, trend shifts or competitive landscape changes that can drive product improvement and innovation.

## Internal Stakeholders

Internal stakeholders are those who work within your organization. Here are a few of the stakeholders that you may communicate with:

1. **Development Team:** You will need to work closely with your development teams to ensure that everyone is aligned in the development of the product. Regular communication is necessary to keep the team updated on product requirements and goals.

2. **Marketing Team:** You need to work with the marketing team to ensure that they understand the product, its features, and its benefits to the target audience. You need to share the product roadmap, key features, target audience and market positioning to ensure they understand the product direction and target users.

3. **Sales Team:** You need to work closely with the sales team to understand customer's feedback, opportunities and complaints. It is important to communicate regularly with your sales team to ensure they have the product knowledge needed to sell it to potential customers, which ultimately drives product adoption and revenue.

4. **Executives:** You need to communicate regularly with executives and provide progress updates on the product development process. This helps ensure that the product is aligned with the company's goals, and it can also help secure the necessary resources and budget for product development.

## External Stakeholders

External stakeholders are those who work outside your organization. Here are a few of the stakeholders that you may communicate with:

1. **Partners:** Product managers often work with partners, distributors or resellers who sell the products. It is crucial to communicate and train these external partners on the product features, selling points and differentiation points, so they can sell more products with better efficiency. Regular communication and feedback channeling is necessary to address queries or issues they face.

2. **Customers:** Communication with customers is fundamental to making sure that they are happy with the product and are willing to continue using it. Product managers have to continuously collect and analyze feedback from customers on the product’s performance, features, and satisfaction. It’s also essential to communicate updates on new features, enhancements or changes to ensure that the product remains valuable to them.

3. **Industry Experts:** Industry experts can provide important feedback on the current state of the market, emerging trends and what could be the next disruptor. Product managers can leverage this information to shape the product roadmap and ensure that it remains competitive in the market.

4. **Investors:** Investors want to know how their money is being spent, and they need to be assured that the product development process is in good hands. Regular communication and updates keep the investors informed on the product’s progress, customer feedback, sales growth, and any issues that may impact the development or market performance of the product.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, communication is an essential aspect of Product Management. A Product Manager has to ensure that communication channels are open to internal and external stakeholders to keep everyone informed, aligned, and focused on the development and success of the product. Effective communication practices can help improve the overall quality of the product and the processes required to bring them to market.
