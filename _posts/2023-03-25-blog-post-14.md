I'll be creating my brand new Product, following the program with you, and asking for your early product feedback to decide on the next product directions.

And you don't need to learn how to code to start - we will use no-code software development tools to create a functional Product in a matter of days or weeks. These tools allow you to create working software without necessarily knowing how to write code in a traditional software engineering sense. Creating products with no code will not only let you test your product ideas faster but also strengthen your first or next application for a Product Manager role and make you stand out from other candidates.
