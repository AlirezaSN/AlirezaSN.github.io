Preface
======
Are you interested in learning more about a particular industry, company, or job role? Do you want to gain valuable insights from professionals who have experience in the field? If so, an informational interview may be just what you need!

An informational interview is a type of meeting where you can ask questions and gain information from someone who has experience in a particular industry or job role. Unlike a job interview, the purpose of an informational interview is not to get hired but to gain insights and information about the industry and job role. This can be a valuable tool for job seekers who want to learn more about potential career paths, network with professionals, and gain insights into the job market.

In this article, I will discuss what an informational interview is and its benefits, how to identify potential interviewees and reach out to them, how to prepare for the interview, and what questions to ask.
