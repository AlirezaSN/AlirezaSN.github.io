Hey there! 👋

I'm Alireza Sadeghi-Nasab. I’m a Product Manager with over 9 years of experience in the fintech industry, combining a strong technical foundation with a deep understanding of user-centered product development. With a background as a software engineer and an academic journey that includes a BSc, MSc, and PhD in Software Engineering, I bring both practical and analytical perspectives to building digital products.

Throughout my career, I’ve managed SaaS B2C products — particularly mobile applications — that empower users to interact with complex financial systems through intuitive, reliable, and scalable solutions. I’m passionate about bridging the gap between technology and user needs, leading cross-functional teams, and delivering data-driven products that create measurable business value.
